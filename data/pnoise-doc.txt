 pnoise3 = noise3(x, y, z, octaves=1, persistence=0.5, lacunarity=2.0repeatx=1024, repeaty=1024, repeatz=1024, base=0.0)
 return perlin "improved" noise value for specified coordinate

        octaves -- specifies the number of passes for generating fBm noise,
        defaults to 1 (simple noise).        

        persistence -- specifies the amplitude of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it. Defaults to 0.5 (each higher octave's amplitude
        is halved). Note the amplitude of the 
first pass is always 1.0.

        lacunarity -- specifies the frequency 
of each successive octave relative
        to the one below it, similar to persistence. Defaults to 2.0.

        repeatx, repeaty, repeatz -- specifies the interval along each axis when
        the noise values repeat. This can be used as the tile size for creating
        tileable textures

        base -- specifies a fixed offset for the input coordinates. Useful for
        generating different noise textures with the same repeat interval
