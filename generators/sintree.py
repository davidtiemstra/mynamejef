# here i wanna try doing the plant generator where it
# 1. squiggles up towards a branch
# 2. squiggles down along almost the same path slightly offset through the trunk towards a root
# 3. goes back up along that path.

# i feel like a really elegant way to do that would be to combine a sine function with
# a flow field. but maybe then branches and roots wouldnt pass over eachother.
# lets just try some stuff
