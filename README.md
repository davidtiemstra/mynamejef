### Explanation
- All scripts that generate a path belong in the 'generators' directory. They should be executed from main.py. <br>
- All embroidery files should be written to the 'experiment_files' directory. <br>
- All helper scripts (e.g., file encoding scripts, path render scripts, stitch algorithms, etc.) belong in the 'helpers' directory.
- All test scripts or works in progress belong in the 'test_scripts' directory.

When working on a script, all code should be executed from main.py and main.py should be cleaned before pushing to Github.
